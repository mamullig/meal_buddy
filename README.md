# meal_buddy
This project is the outcome of an assignment for EC601:'Product Design in Electrical and Computer Engineering' at Boston University. The goal was to focus on a product mission statement and user stories. This resulting application utilizes Google's Gemini API and Python's Kivy. To run the application, one must have an API key that can be obtained at this [link](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key).

To run: 'python3 meal_buddy_app.py'

The “Meal Buddy” app assists busy people with the curation of a custom meal prepping schedule and the necessary grocery list - all within the user’s budget, personal schedule, and dietary needs - to help them fuel their bodies while still focusing on other things.
